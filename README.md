# 📈 Market-Forecast — ML-based Stock Price Prediction

A robust machine learning system for predicting stock prices using historical market data and technical indicators. This repository provides a full-stack solution with modular backend, frontend, and AI/ML components, enabling research, deployment, and visualization of market forecasts.

## 📊 Features

- **AI/ML Engine:** Advanced models for time-series forecasting and feature engineering in `AI_ML/`.
- **Backend API:** RESTful backend for data access, model serving, and integration under `backend/`.
- **Frontend Dashboard:** Interactive web interface for visualization and analytics located in `frontend/`.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Seamless setup via `docker-compose.yml` for reproducible environments.
- **Package Management:** Includes both Python (`setup.py`) and Node.js (`package.json`) support.
